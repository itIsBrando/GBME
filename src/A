A.)
phytoplankton - photosynthesis
zooplankton - eat phytoplankton
grayling    - eat zooplankton
Lake Trout  - eat grayling

B.)
Only 10% of each of energy from each trophic level is carried on to the next level

phytoplankton has 100% of its energy
zooplankton has 10%
grayling 1%
lake trout has 0.1%

The biomass decreases at higher trophic levels
 (thats why there are enough prey for predators)


C.)
The toxin would likely be ineffective in damaging 
  the organisms that are low in the web, but biological magnification
  will cause an accumulation of toxins for the lake trout and other
  organisms on a high level.
